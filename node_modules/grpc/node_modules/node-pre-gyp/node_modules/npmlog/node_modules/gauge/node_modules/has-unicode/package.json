In many localizations it\nstill uses legacy code pages and there's no facility short of running\nprograms or linking C++ that will let us detect this. As such, we\nreport any Windows installation as NOT unicode capable, and recommend\nthat you encourage your users to override this via config.\n\n### Unix Like Operating Systems\n\nWe look at the environment variables `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, and `LANG` in\nthat order.  For `LC_ALL` and `LANG`, it looks for `.UTF-8` in the value. \nFor `LC_CTYPE` it looks to see if the value is `UTF-8`.  This is sufficient\nfor most POSIX systems.  While locale data can be put in `/etc/locale.conf`\nas well, AFAIK it's always copied into the environment.\n\n",
